Business Scenario & Challenges
AT ITC,DI (Direct Input) Items—which are non-codified—are immediately purged from the system once a Goods Receipt Note (GRN) is posted. Unlike codified procurement, where standardized item descriptions and categorizations enable systematic tracking and comparison, DI item procurement poses several challenges:
1.Lack of Standardization:
1.Since no predefined syntax is imposed, item descriptions vary significantly, making it difficult to categorize, compare, or track them effectively.
2.Example: A procurement entry may describe the same item differently across transactions:
1.“Industrial Solvent 10L”
2.“Solvent Chemical, 10 Liters”
3.“Cleaning Solution for Manufacturing, 10L”
2.Financial Impact & High Annual Spend:
1.DI item procurement represents a significant financial volume annually, yet inefficiencies lead to higher costsdue to inconsistent pricing and missed opportunities for bulk negotiations.
3.Inability to Track or Compare Rates:
1.Without a codified system, there is no mechanism to compare rates across locations, vendors, or past purchases. This makes it difficult to identify the best deal based on historical data or current market offerings.
2.Example: A company purchasing industrial lubricants might pay 10% more in one region compared to another, simply due to the lack of price benchmarking.
4.Missed Negotiation Opportunities:
1.Past procurement data is not leveragedto negotiate better rates with vendors.
2.Without visibility into overall purchase volumeacross locations, companies miss out on bulk discounts or favorable vendor terms.
3.Example: If a company has procured 50,000 units of a component over the year from different vendors, no consolidated insightis available to negotiate a better annual contract.
